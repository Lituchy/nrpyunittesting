# [evaluate_globals] takes in a module dictionary [mod_dict] and locals [old_locals] and returns a dictionary
# [result_dict] containing the symbolic expressions for each global specified in mod_dict

# Requires: Modules can't have the same name. Two globals for a given module can't have the same name.
#           Functions must be able to be called on their respective module. Globals must 
#           be defined in their respective modules.
# Returns: Returns [resultDict], which is a dictionary whose keys are the modules that were passed 
#          through modDict and the values are dictionaries containing the values for the specified globals
# Note: Must pass in locals() as second argument to insure that all imports that have been done are accessible
#       by the evaluateGlobals module

# Called by run_test
