    "it's a bit arbitrary, so whether you prefer BrillLindquist or bl, it\n",

    "print statements will only be called in the first function, since there\n",
    "is no associated initialization_string for the second function as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note when using `create_test` is that all arguments are\n",
    "**strings**. This includes the module, module_name, function, each\n",
    "global in the list of globals, logging level, and initialization_string.\n",
    "The reason for making these fields strings is that when setting\n",
    "module_name, for example, there doesn't exist anything in Python with\n",
    "the name BrillLindquist. So, we wrap it in a string. This is true of\n",
    "every input. Be careful with the dicts and lists, however: their\n",
    "arguments are strings, they aren't themselves strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this funciton actually do at a lower level? First, `create_test` makes sure that all user arguments are of the correct type, failing if any are incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then loops through every function in `function_and_global_dict`, and creates `file_string`, a string that represents a unit test file that will be executed. Along with the current function comes its global list, and initialization string if it has one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the contents from [run_test](#run_test) is copied into `file_string` so that the test will be automatically run, and so the user can easily see their unique file contents in case of an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A file is then created which houses the `file_string`, and is what gets called with a bash script. The file exists in the directory of the test being run, and is deleted upon test success, but left for the user to inspect upon test failure. `file_string` has code to call both [setup_trusted_values_dict](#setup_trusted_values_dict) and [run_test](#run_test) in order to ensure that the test will run correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the test file is called using [cmdline_helper](../../edit/cmdline_helper.py), which runs the test and does everything described in [run_test](#run_test).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `run_test` finishes, either the test failed or the test succeeded. `file_string` has additonal code to create a `success.txt` file if the test passes, and do nothing otherwise. So, `create_test` looks for the existence of `success.txt`. If it exists, we delete it and create_test has finished for the current function and moves on to the next function. Otherwise, if `success.txt` doesn't exist, an exception is thrown to be caught later.\n"
