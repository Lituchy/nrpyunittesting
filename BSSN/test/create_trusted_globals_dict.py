# createTrustedGlobalsDict takes in a module dictionary [mod_dict] and a boolean list [first_times].
# For each module, if [first_time] is True, then an empty dict is returned.
# This ensures that when the dictionary is passed into [calc_error], there will be an error.
# If [first_time] is False, then a dictionary that contains every module in ModDict as keys, and each module's
# respective dictionary from trusted_values_dict as values. The naming convention for the dictionaries is as follows:
#   trusted_values_dict['(MODULE_NAME)Globals'] -- The module name with 'Globals' concatenated on the end.
#   This is consistent throughout all files.
# Throws an [AssertionError] if [mod_dict] and [first_times] contain different keys.
# Throws a [KeyError] if [first_time] is true for a module whose entry isn't in [trusted_values_dict].
